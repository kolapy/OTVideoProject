# OTVideoProject
A project directory template and a utility to clean it up before archiving.

## Usage
Clone this repository into your working directory and rename it as you see fit.

**Mac OS**
Recommend installing Brew first. (The first command below)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git
git clone https://github.com/kolapy/OTVideoProject.git
```

**Ubuntu**
Use APT
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/kolapy/OTVideoProject.git
```

**Windows**
Recommend installing Chocolatey first. https://chocolatey.org/
```powershell
choco install git -y
git clone https://github.com/kolapy/OTVideoProject.git
```

**The CleanUp Utility**
Once the project is ready for archive I recommend using the cleanup utility to remove any unused folders from the directory.

Simply double click on the executable and wait for it to finish.
